# Databases

* Create a program that can be used by a bookstore clerk. The program should allow the clerk to:
  * enter new books into the database
  * update book information
  * delete books from the database
  * search the database to find a specific book.

* Create a database called ebookstore and a table called books.

* Populate the table with the above values. You can also add your own values if you wish.

* The program should present the user with the following menu:
  ```
    1. Enter book 
    2. Update book 
    3. Delete book 
    4. Search books 
    0. Exit
  ```
  The program should perform the function that the user selects. The implementation of these functions are left up to you.
